== Description ==One dolphin is killed every 15 minute. We want to spread the word and stop the poachers. Use the widget or insert the shortcode [dolphins_countdown].<br><br> We work to make the horrors of the current dolphin situation known, to work to ensure that this stops, not when itâ€™s too late, but now.
